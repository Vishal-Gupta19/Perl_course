# Values and Variables

- In Perl, a variable contains one or more values. A value is a unit of data. It may be numeric, textural, or logical. 
- A variable is simply a named container for one or more values. Perl doesn't use types in the same way that some other languages use types.
- To distinguish between integers, floats, and text, Perl uses context to determine type. This is a system called Duck Typing. In other words, if it quacks like a duck, it must be a duck.
- A variable name may consist of any combination of characters but it's generally considered good practice to restrict your variable names to the set of lowercase and uppercase Roman letters, the 10 ASCII decimal digits and the underscore symbol.
- Perl provides three basic storage types. A scalar holds a single value. A scalar variable is introduced with the dollar symbol.
